# Exercise 5: Temperature Conversion

unit = input("Is this temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (C/F): ")
temp = float(input("Enter the temperature: "))

# While creating if statements, you can use the keyword PASS to be a space filler until you set the condition
if unit == "C":
    pass
elif unit == "F":
    pass
